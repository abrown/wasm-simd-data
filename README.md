# Introduction

NOTHING TO SEE HERE (yet).

The plan is for this repository to house data about the performance of WASM SIMD instructions on various architectures.  This includes:

 * Which instruction(s) various WASM SIMD instructions are expected to be lowered to on various architectures with different CPU features.
 * Timing information for each implementation for at least some architectures.
 * Links to Compiler Explorer where reports form llvm-mca can be customized for other CPUs.

We are currently working on a plan for how exactly to go about putting this together; see the "Discussions" tab to get involved.
